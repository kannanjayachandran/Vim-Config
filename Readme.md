# Vim

## This is a collection of my vim configuration files and plugins

### Installing Plugins

I am using _Vim Plug_ to manage my plugins. To install the plugins, first find the github repo for the plugin and add it to the `init.vim` file. Then run the following command in vim:

```vim

    :PlugInstall

```

### Uninstalling Plugins

To uninstall a plugin, remove the line from the `init.vim` file and run the following command in vim:

```vim

    :PlugClean

```
